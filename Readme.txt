Hi this is the Readme file for my Gsoc 2012 project "Object Based Image Analysis Tooles for Opticks"

It has a folder named OA.
1. Copy OA  "<SDK-directory>\application\PlugIns\src\"
2. COpy OBIA_plugin.sln to "<SDK-directory>\application\"
3. run OBIA_plugin in visual studio and build as per your choice.


For running the plugin in opticks :
Copy the dll files from Release folder of build "<sdk-directory>\Build\Binaries-Win32-release\PlugIns\" to the plugin folder of Opticks installation. 
Run opticks.
